  <h1>Didzis Melbiksis</h1>
  <p><i>Strategic Communicator | Media Specialist | Human Rights Advocate | Future-Oriented Thinker</i></p>
  <p><b>Didzis Melbiksis</b> is a multilingual communications strategist with over two decades of experience across journalism, international organizations, and public service. Currently working as a Press Communicator at the Swedish Migration Agency, he helps shape public understanding of some of society‚Äôs most complex and politically sensitive issues.<br>

Prior to this, Didzis held senior communication roles at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), where he led strategic campaigns, managed media relations, and served as spokesperson across the Nordic and Baltic regions. He is also a former journalist, having reported for national media in Latvia and Sweden ‚Äî a foundation that honed his sharp analytical instincts, storytelling skills, and deep sense of social responsibility.<br>

But beyond the CV, Didzis is known as someone who sees things coming.<br>

Over the past years, he has immersed himself in the fast-moving world of **artificial intelligence** ‚Äî not only as a curious observer, but as an active learner and strategic thinker. Long before AI became a buzzword, he recognized its transformative potential across communication, governance, and public engagement. This foresight is no coincidence: whether in media, migration policy, or future technologies, Didzis has a habit of spotting the signal before it becomes the noise.<br>

Colleagues describe him as reflective yet action-oriented, analytical yet empathetic. He combines **Nordic calm**, **Baltic resilience**, and a **quiet passion** for clarity, fairness, and doing meaningful work in uncertain times.<br>

<p>üîπ Native Latvian, fluent in Swedish, English, and Russian<br>

üîπ Based in Stockholm, rooted in Europe, connected globally<br>

üîπ Always ready for new collaborations ‚Äî especially the kind that matter<br></p>
